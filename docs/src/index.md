## What can you do with it

- Create surface in random directions around current model parameters.
- Create surface between model checkpoints in x- and y-directions.
- Create trajectory between model checkpoints. This way you can visualize
  path that optimizer took during training, for example.

!!! note
    All models that you provide via checkpoint files, should contain
    parameters under `checkpoint_weights` key.

    Saving weights like this in code would look like
    `BSON.@save file checkpoint_weights`.
